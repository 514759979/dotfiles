This isn't the 1st skin I did for Winamp, but this is the 1st one I am putting out for mp3 users to check out. I thought it was pretty cool to do & I had some time on my hands. If ya got any questions or comments on how or what I should do to make it better or if you want to tell me what a good (or bad :P) job I did on this, email me. (It's on the bottom of this page) Also, I got a good amount of mp3s, so if you want to check out my mp3 list, email me. Well, with that, I'm out.
